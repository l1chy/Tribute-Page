                    <p class="info">The most famous line in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1983_film)" target="_blank" id="scarface">Scarface</a>, one of the best movies Al Pacino participated in as a main character and personally one of my favourites. </p>
                    <p class="info">Al Pacino's acting demands an artistic reverence. Unlike any other actor his body language speaks more dialogues than his speech. Al Pacino is one actor whose acting as a villain inspires us. Who else can portray a negative character and yet influence us in a way like Al Pacino?</p>
                    <p class="info">Another distinguishing trait of Al is his subtlety, he manages to portray his characters so quietly that makes the experience of watching him lively and magical. He can play big or small, loud or soft, tireless or exhausted, always as if it’s the only note he has. . . Pacino has an extraordinary range of styles, and a pitch-perfect ability to evoke them. There is no such thing as “the Al Pacino performance,” because there are too many different kinds of them.</p>
                    <p class="info">He has been a great philanthropist as well! Pacino turned down Star Wars and gave the world Harrison Ford. He turned down Die Hard and we came to know about Bruce Willis. He left out of Apocalypse Now and Martin Sheen emerged. He made way for Richard Gere in Pretty Woman... can go forever!</p>
                    <p class="info" lang="en">At the end, I must say that Al Pacino always inspires me in one way or another with him saying  <q><span id="conclusion"> All I am is what I am going after.</span></q></p>
